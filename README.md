# Peak Everything Analytics Project

This is a personal project to analyze various long-term sustainability factors in different assumptions and scenarios.  I'm particularly interested in the side effects of peak human population.  

## TODO

- get country summary working again, need to fix UN2022
- make country compare more useful
- create function to get value from each for a given year
- maybe make version where all are loaded into structure that can be queried?
